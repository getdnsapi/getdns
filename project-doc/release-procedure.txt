High level release procedure that we follow to make a formal release for the
getdns API project.  This is a recipe - if you have a better way to do it then
update this document and share it with us.

- code freeze
    confirm with core team that all commits are in, from this point forward
    only bug fixes will be included in the release branch

- create a release branch
    in git repository named for the release, e.g. "v0.1.2"
    we do this because folks may want to continue to work in the master branch
    and be free to commit changes without injuring the release process.  Since
    building and testing binaries for a release takes a few days we don't want to
    force changes to queue up.

    One might argue that a release can be cut more quickly, however there are 
    inevitably little tweaks that need to be made that get uncovered as a result
    of the binary builds - these tweaks need to be included in the souces for
    this release so building the source tarball can't be done until all of the
    binaries have been built and tested.

- clone repo release branch to a clean local repo
    this should be a brand spanking new directory - don't try to shortcut it and
    use a working directory with lots of cruft - crap will find its way into the
    release and embarass you:

    # git clone -b v0.1.2 https://github.com/getdnsapi/getdns.git getdns-0.1.2

- update files to reflect release number/date
    ./README.md
    ./ChangeLog 
    ./configure.ac (AC_INIT)

    # autoreconf

    commit these changes to the release branch

    # git commit -a -m "release number and date updates"
    # git push

- build binaries for each target platform
    - create clean local repo

    - build source distribution tar, test build the resulting tar
      # ./configure
      # make dist
      # openssl sha1 getdns-0.1.2.tar.gz > getdns-0.1.2.tar.gz.sha1
      # openssl md5 getdns-0.1.2.tar.gz > getdns-0.1.2.tar.gz.md5

    - build OSX binary disk image

    - build code (no additional libraries, note that regression tests will not build)
      if you are building a simple binary tar then something like this works
      # ./configure --prefix=/Users/gwiley/getdnsox/export
      # make
      # make install
      # tar -C /Users/gwiley/getdnsosx/export -cvf getdns-0.1.2.tar *

    - build code (with libevent)
      # ./configure --with-libevent2

    - run regression tests and verify that alls well

    if you have do do anything even mildly interesting to get the build or install to
    work then we either have to add it to the README.md or, preferably, fix it
    and update the branch

    Be careful about tool sets loaded on your build hosts.  You may have 'solved' 
    problems while you are working that mask issues with the build for more typical
    users - this is why we want to build on hosts that are representative of
    our users.

- install on each target platform
    - make sure and use a user that was NOT used for the build, this will uncover 
      any silliness related to absolute paths in the build

- if a build breaks or an install fails then commit fixes to the relase branch
  - rebuild EVERY binary using the changed release branch

- merge branch changes back into master

- once all binaries are built and tested clean, create source tar ball
  and the actual package for each platform

  you may need to run this as root to permit the chown
  # make clean
  # make dist
  generates getdns-0.1.2.tar.gz

- generate checksums for each binary/source tar

- upload source and binaries to the getdnsapi.net site

- create a release in the github repository
    - from the main repo choose 'releases'
    - choose 'Draft a new release'
    - use tag v0.x.y to match the branch being released
    - for a release name use getdns-0.x.y
    - for description cut/paste the ChangeLog entry

- update getdnsapi.net web site 
    - push binaries to getdnsapi.net 
        /usr/local/www/apache24/data/dist
    - news entry for the release
        /usr/local/www/apache24/data/news.html
    -  download links and checksums
        /usr/local/www/apache24/data/frontpage.html
    - rebuild website
        # ./build.sh

- announce message to
    getdns mailing list
    stub-resolvers mailing list
    Verisign internal via the matrix

- update the 


List of Build Targets
---------------------
The naming conventions for each of these build products are specific to the
platform they target.  The result is that the naming seems a little inconsistent,
however I felt that it is best to follow naming standards for the platform rather
than try to impose a project specific standard across platforms.

- source tar: getdns-0.1.2.tar.gz
- OSX binary package: getdns-0.1.2-OSX_10_8.dmg
- RHEL/CentOS: getdns-0.1.0-1.CentOS_6_5.x86_64.rpm
- Debian/Ubuntu:
