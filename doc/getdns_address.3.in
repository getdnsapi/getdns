.SH DESCRIPTION

.LP
The getdns_address(3) and getdns_address_sync functions provide public entry points into the getdns API library to retrieve the address given a host name.  It always returns both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

.HP 3
.I context
.RP
see getdns_context (3)

.HP 3
.I name
.RP
the host name to resolve to an address (note that an IP address is considered invalid)

.HP 3
.I extensions
.RP
extensions for this request, NULL if no extensions, see libgetdns (3) for a detailed description of extensions

.HP 3
.I userarg
.RP
returned to the callback function untouched, can be NULL

.HP 3
.I transaction_id
.RP
populated by the API and used to identify the callback (for example to getdns_cancel_callback), can be NULL, set to 0 if the function fails

.HP 3
.I callbackfn
.RP
pointer to a callback function defined by the application, typically used to process the response, may not be NULL. Only the asynchronous signature accepts a callback function, the synchronous signature does not include a callback.

.HP 3
.I response_length
.RP
The synchronous entry point includes this argument, the response length is placed at the address pointed to by response_length.

.HP 3
.I response
.RP
A getdns_dict type is returned in response and always contains at least three names: replies_full (a list containing the DNS response as binary data), replies_tree (a list containing the parsed DNS response data) and status (an int).  The storage associated with this must be freed by a call to getdns_free_sync_request_memory (3).

.HP
.SH "RETURN VALUES"

Upon successful completion the functions return
.B GETDNS_RETURN_GOOD
, otherwise the following error values are returned:

.LP
.B GETDNS_RETURN_BAD_CONTEXT 
if the context pointer is invalid
.LP
.B GETDNS_RETURN_BAD_DOMAIN_NAME
if the domain name passed to the function is invalid
.LP
.B GETDNS_RETURN_EXTENSION_MISFORMAT
if the data type specified in one or more of the extensions does not match the specifications
.LP
.B GETDNS_RETURN_NO_SUCH_EXTENSION
if one or more of the strings specified in the extensions are not valid

The values of status in the response include:

.LP
.B GETDNS_RESPSTATUS_GOOD
At least one response was returned
.LP
.B GETDNS_RESPSTATUS_NO_NAME
Queries for the name yielded all negative responses
.LP
.B GETDNS_RESPSTATUS_ALL_TIMEOUT
All queries for the name timed out
.LP
.B GETDNS_RESPSTATUS_NO_SECURE_ANSWERS
only secure replies accepted (per context), at least one response was received but no DNS responses were secure through DNSSEC

.LP
