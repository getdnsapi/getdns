* 2015-11-??: Version 0.5.1
  * Bufix: growing upstreams arrow.

* 2015-10-29: Version 0.5.0
  * Native crypto.  No ldns dependency anymore.
    (ldns still necessary to be able to run tests though)
  * JSON pointer arguments to getdns_dict_get_* and getdns_dict_set_* 
    to dereference nested dicts and lists.
  * Bugfix: DNSSEC code finding zone cut with redirects + pursuing unsigned
    DS answers close to the root.  Thanks Theogene Bucuti!
  * Default port for TLS changed to 853
  * Unofficial extension to the API to allow TLS hostname verification to be
    required for stub mode when using only TLS as a transport. 
    When required a hostname must be supplied in the
    'hostname' field of the upstream_list dict and the TLS cipher suites are
    restricted to the 4 AEAD suites recommended in RFC7525.

    Stub mode will be the default.  Removes the dependency on libunbound
  * --with-getdns_query compiles and installs the getdns_query tool too
  * Fix assert on context destruction from a callback in stub mode too.
  * Use a thread instead of a process for running the unbound event loop.

  * Fix repeating rdata fields

* 2015-07-17: Version 0.3.0
  * Unit test for spurious execute bits.  Thanks Paul Wouters.
  * Added new transport list options in API. The option is now an ordered

    GETDNS_TRANSPORT_TLS, GETDNS_TRANSPORT_STARTTLS.
  * Added new context setting for idle_timeout
  * CSYNC RR type

  * Switch freely between stub and recursive mode
  * getdns_query -k shows default trust anchors
  * functions and defines to get library and API versions in string
    and numeric values: getdns_get_version(), getdns_get_version_number(),
    getdns_get_api_version() and getdns_get_api_version_number()

  * The GETDNS_TRANSPORT_TLS_ONLY_KEEP_CONNECTIONS_OPEN and
    GETDNS_TRANSPORT_TLS_FIRST_AND_FALL_BACK_TO_TCP_KEEP_CONNECTIONS_OPEN
    DNS over TLS transport options. 

* 2015-04-08: Version 0.1.7
  * Individual getter functions for context settings
  * Fix: --with-current-date function to make build deterministically
    reproducible (i.e. the GETDNS_COMPILATION_COMMENT define from
    getdns.h contains a date value).  Thanks Ondřej Surý
  * Fix: Include m4 dir in distribution tarball
  * Fix: Link build requirements in tests too.  Thanks Ondřej Surý

    found after following all CNAMEs
  * Implementation of the section 6 and 7 version of 
    draft-ietf-dnsop-cookies-01.txt for stub resolution.  Enable with the
    --enable-draft-edns-cookies option to configure.  Use it by setting the
    edns_cookies extension to GETDNS_EXTENSION_TRUE.
  * Pretty printing of lists with:
    char *getdns_pretty_print_list(getdns_list *list)
  * Output to json format with:
    char * getdns_print_json_dict(const getdns_dict *some_dict, int pretty);
    char * getdns_print_json_list(const getdns_list *some_list, int pretty);
  * snprintf style versions of the dict, list and json print functions.
  * Better random number generation with OpenBSD's arc4random
  * Let getdns_address schedule the AAAA query first.  This results in AAAA
    being the first in the just_address_answers sections of the response dict.
  * New context update callback function to also return a user given argument
    along with the context and which item was changed.
    Thanks Scott Hollenbeck.
  * Demotivate use of getdns_strerror and expose getdns_get_errorstr_by_id.
    Thanks Scott Hollenbeck.

    values will adhere to the suggestions in RFC 6891 and may follow
    a scheme that uses multiple values to maximize receptivity.
  * Stub mode use 1232 maximum UDP payload size when connecting to an
    IPv6 upstreams and 1432 with an IPv4 upstream.
  * Evaluate namespaces (or not) on a per query basis
  * GETDNS_NAMESPACE_LOCALNAMES namespace now gives just_address_answers
    only and does not mimic a DNS packet answer anymore
  * The add_opt_parameters extension
  * IPv6 scope_id support with link-local addresses.  Both with parsing
    /etc/resolv.conf and by providing them explicitly via
    getdns_context_set_upstream_recursive_servers
  * Query for A and AAAA simultaneously with return_both_v4_and_v6
  * GETDNS_TRANSPORT_TCP_ONLY_KEEP_CONNECTIONS_OPEN DNS transport
  * Fix: Answers without RRs in query secion (i.e. REFUSED)

    getdns_context_set_edns_maximum_udp_payload_size() now working
  * <rr>_unknown rdata field for unknown or unsupported RR types
  * Temporarily disable timeout unit test 3 because of unpredictable results
  * Spec updated to version 0.507
  * Renamed "resolver_type" to "resolution_type" in dict returned from
    getdns_context_get_api_information()
  * Added GETDNS_RESPSTATUS_ALL_BOGUS_ANSWERS return code for with the
    dnssec_return_only_secure extension
  * Added support for CDS and CDNSKEY RR types, but needs ldns > 1.6.17 to
