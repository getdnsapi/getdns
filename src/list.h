/**
 * getdns list data type
 * Use helper functions getdns_list_* to manipulate and iterate lists
 * lists are implemented as arrays internally since the helper functions
 * like to reference indexes in the list.  Elements are allocated in blocks
 * and then marked valid as they are used and invalid as they are not used
 * The use cases do not justify working too hard at shrinking the structures.
 * Indexes are 0 based.
